# NoTweet-Swift
This is a twitter character counting app written in Swift 3, and set for iOS 10

##Description##

NoTweet will do a character count of your tweets. There is no way of posting to Twitter, it only does a character count. This application will take into account upcoming Twitter changes where the username will not count towards the character count.

The idea for the app came from Ricky Mondello [@rmondello](http://www.twitter.com/rmondello) on Twitter.
